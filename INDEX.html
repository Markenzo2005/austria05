            <h2>Cloud Automation</h2>
            Cloud automation refers to the implementation of tools and processes in an effort to reduce the manual
            intervention associated with provisioning, configuring, and managing public, private, and hybrid cloud
            environments.

            <ul>

                <li><b>Getting Decision-Makers On Board With Automation:</b>
                    Challenges may arise before you even start using automation at your organization. That’s because you
                    may have difficulty convincing the senior members of the organization that using automation is the
                    right move. That’s crucial if some or all of those parties have direct influence over whether or not
                    you have the financial resources needed to make automation work.
                    <br>
                <li><b> Implementing Automation While Being Mindful Of Cybersecurity Infrastructure</b>:</b>
                    Cybersecurity is a sector that’s ripe for automation. The technology can help cybersecurity teams
                    become more aware of the type and volume of threats. It can also enable them to assess which
                    problems are genuine, and which could be false alarms.
                    <br>
                <li><b>Not Choosing An Automation Strategy For Your Business Type:</b>
                    Some companies only think of deploying automation in a non-specific way. They don’t research
                    thoroughly enough to determine the best ways to apply automation to their respective industries.
                    <br>
                <li><b>Pushback From Employees Worried About Being Replaced By Automation:</b>
                    An announcement that your company plans to start using automation may make workers start fretting
                    that their jobs are at risk. The Pew Research Center carried out a global poll to get people’s
                    feelings on the matter.
                    <br>
                <li><b> Failing To Use Metrics That Assess The Company’s Progress Towards Goals:</b>
                    Setting goals associated with your automation plans is essential. But don’t stop there. You must
                    also determine which statistics you’ll use to check whether you’re making headway in meeting those
                    milestones.
                    <br>
                <li><b>Not Setting Aside Enough Time For Training:</b>
                    Increased efficiency is usually one of the top benefits businesses bring up when highlighting the
                    improvements automation can bring about. It’s one that you can probably look forward to as well, but
                    only if you build training time into the staff schedule for employees to learn how to use the
                    automation technology and become more comfortable with it.
                    <br>
                <li><b>Planning Prevents Pitfalls:</b>
                    Understanding which obstacles companies often encounter when using automation is crucial. This
                    knowledge helps you determine the best ways to prevent barriers to improvement at your organization.
                    The obstacles and solutions presented here should play a definitive role in setting you up for
                    success.
